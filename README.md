# OpenM1
OpenM1 is an experimental project for the development and build of TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers' applications on Windows OS and refers to the [OpenR8](https://www.openrobot.club/article/index?sn=10935) concept to provide a GUI environment. The [original](https://github.com/on-device-ai/OpenM1/tree/original
) branch used [MSYS2](https://anaconda.org/msys2/repo) as a build environment, but the master branch used to Windows 10 [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/about) as a build environment. Currently only "Deploy to SparkFun Edge" of "Hello World example" is implemented.
